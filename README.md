# Shotor
## Word Level OCR Dataset for Persian Language

Shotor (means camel in Persian) is a free synthetic dataset for Word Level OCR.    
The current version contains 120000 images and corresponding words.  

To see an example of using the Shotor dataset see this notebook:  
[A simple word level OCR for Persian Language using Pytorch and OpenCV](https://github.com/amirabbasasadi/PersianOCR)  


I used these resourses to create word lists:  
- Persian Wikipedia
- [Ganjoor Website](https://ganjoor.net/)
- [Persian Spell Checking Data](https://github.com/reza1615/Persian-Spell-checker) by [reza1615](https://github.com/reza1615)

The images have been generated using multiple fonts:
- a few fonts from https://rastikerdar.github.io/
- and a some font from https://www.fontirani.ir/
